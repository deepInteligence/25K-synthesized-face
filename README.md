# Human Faces Dataset Generated by Stable Diffusion

## Overview
This dataset contains over 25,000 high-quality synthetic human face images generated using the Stable Diffusion model. It is designed to support research and development in computer vision, machine learning, and related fields. The images represent diverse demographics, including variations in age, gender, ethnicity, and facial expressions.

## Motivation
Creating datasets for face analysis often involves ethical concerns regarding privacy and consent. Synthetic data generated by models like Stable Diffusion addresses these concerns while still providing realistic and diverse samples. This dataset aims to:
- Facilitate research in face recognition, analysis, and generation.
- Provide a resource free from ethical constraints associated with real human data.
- Enable testing and validation of models in applications like emotion recognition, demographic analysis, and more.

## Generation Process
The dataset was generated using the Stable Diffusion model, a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model. Custom prompts were crafted to ensure diversity in demographic and stylistic attributes. Post-processing was performed to ensure uniform resolution and quality.

## Usage
This dataset is free to use for academic and commercial purposes under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license. Users are required to provide appropriate credit if using this dataset in their work.

## Potential Applications
- Training and testing face recognition algorithms.
- Research on bias in facial analysis models.
- Development of generative models.
- Applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and gaming.

## Limitations
While synthetic data eliminates privacy concerns, it is not a perfect replacement for real-world data. Models trained solely on synthetic datasets may not generalize well to real-world scenarios. Users are advised to combine this dataset with other sources for better performance.
